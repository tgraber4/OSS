<h1>OSS (Objects in Space Simulator)</h1> <img width="1919" height="942" alt="Objects in Space Simulator" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b841e270-4105-496b-9673-7d42e0bbc652" /> <h2>Overview</h2> <p> Objects in Space Simulator (OSS) is a 2D physics-based space simulator that allows users to create and experiment with custom planetary systems. Users can place planets, modify physical properties, and observe how gravitational forces affect motion in real time. </p> <h2>Built With</h2> <ul> <li>JavaScript</li> <li>Konva.js</li> <li>Python</li> <li>Flask</li> </ul> <h2>What It Does</h2> <p> OSS allows users to select planets or the Sun from a built-in object library and drag them into the simulation space. Each object can be customized by changing its mass, radius, velocity, and direction. Once the system is set up, users can start the simulation and watch orbital paths, flybys, and gravitational interactions unfold based on physics calculations. </p> <p> Users can play and pause the simulation at any time, remove objects, or quickly start with preconfigured layouts to explore different scenarios. </p> <h2>Inspiration</h2> <p> The inspiration for this project came from viewing NASA websites that display real-time planetary data. While those visualizations were impressive, we wanted to explore what would happen if the system could be modified. OSS was created to allow users to freely change positions, masses, and velocities and observe how physics determines the outcome. </p> <h2>How We Built It</h2> <p> The frontend was built using Konva.js to handle 2D rendering, animations, and user interaction. The backend was written in Python to perform gravitational physics calculations. Flask was used to connect the frontend and backend, allowing object data and position updates to be exchanged in real time. </p> <h2>Challenges</h2> <p> One of the main challenges was learning how to use Git efficiently while working on shared files, which led to merge conflicts during development. Another challenge was integrating all parts of the project, since the frontend visuals and backend physics depended heavily on each other. </p> <h2>What We Learned</h2> <p> We learned how to use Konva.js, gained a better understanding of gravitational physics, and developed experience with full-stack development. The project also improved our ability to debug real-time systems and collaborate on a larger codebase. </p> <h2>What’s Next</h2> <p> Future improvements could include more advanced physics, additional presets, improved performance, and more customization options for users. </p> <h2>Running the Project</h2> <p>To run the backend locally:</p> <ol> <li>Navigate to the backend directory</li> <li>Activate the virtual environment</li> <li>Start the Flask server</li> </ol> <pre> cd backend .\venv\Scripts\activate flask run </pre>
